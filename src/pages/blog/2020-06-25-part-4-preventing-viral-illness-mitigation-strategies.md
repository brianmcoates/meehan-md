## Isolation and Quarantine

The best way to prevent the transmission or reception of an infectious disease is to quarantine the infected. Nothing protects you from infection better than maintaining a considerable distance between you and an infectious organism.

### Quarantine yourself when you are sick

When sick, you have three duties. Your first duty is to get well. The second is to protect others from becoming exposed and infected by the pathogen infecting you.

There is no better way to fulfill these two duties than to isolate/quarantine yourself while you recover.

At the first signs and symptoms of a cold, flu, or flu-like illness (fever, tiredness, cough, runny-nose, sneezing, diarrhea, etc.), prepare for quarantine. Tell your work, inform your friends and family, organize your sick-care supplies, and prepare to support your immune system as it wars against the microbes invading your body.

### Healthy individuals do not need to quarantine

Healthy people with strong immune systems have a third duty: fearlessly engage the pathogens, allow your immune system to work, develop lifelong immunities to the pathogens you encounter, and, thus, build herd immunity. Herd immunity is the best and only real way to defeat viral diseases and protect the vulnerable members of the population.

## Contact Precautions

Understand the many ways that viruses and bacteria spread and avoid the ways they manage to gain access to your body. The best defense is to completely avoid areas occupied or exposed to infected individuals. When exposed to high risk environments, assume that anything you touch is contaminated, avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently and thoroughly.

Most viruses [spread from person-to-person](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html) or when your hands contact a contaminated surface and transfer the pathogen to your mouth, nose, or eyes ([fomite transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite)).

Person-to-person spread:

* Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
* Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
* Respiratory droplets can land in the mouth, nose, eyes or possibly be inhaled into the lungs of people nearby.
* Respiratory droplets can land on surfaces (floors, door knobs, hand-rails, faucet handles, etc.) where they may remain infectious and capable of transmitting to the hands.

Based on careful review of the medical and experimental literature pertaining to SARS CoV-2 transmission, I believe that person-to-person transmission occurs almost exclusively by respiratory droplets that are too large and heavy to aerosolize. Thus, the droplets do not remain “airborne” for long, nor are they capable of transmitting over long distances (greater than six feet).

“The likelihood of airborne transmission—especially compared with other routes, such as droplets or surfaces—remains unclear. Most researchers still think the new coronavirus is primarily spread via droplets and touching infected people or surfaces. So diligent hand washing and social distancing are still the most important measures people can take to avoid infection.”[[Scientific American, 5/12/2020](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-coronavirus-spreads-through-the-air-what-we-know-so-far1/)]

It is likely that the respiratory droplets containing SARS CoV-2 viral particles quickly fall from the air within seconds and remain within six feet of the infected individual.

## Wash Your Hands with Soap and Warm Water

Washing hands with soap and warm water is the best and most effective way to remove viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens trying to hitch a ride on your hands. Washing your hands will decrease your likelihood of spreading a virus to your nose, mouth and other people.

I do not recommend the use of antibacterial soaps -- antibacterial soaps are unnecessary, more expensive, are no more effective than soap, contain chemicals that can disrupt your endocrine system (such as triclosan), and simply may cause more harm than good. Instead, find a non-toxic, unscented soap and wash your hands thoroughly under warm water.

Avoid hand gels if at all possible. As with the antibacterial soaps, hand gels are mostly ineffective, expensive, and full of toxic ingredients and endocrine disrupting chemicals that add to our bodies already excessive toxic burden.

## Do not touch your face

Our skin provides an excellent and well defended barrier to viral invasion. However, the tissues lining the mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and lungs are not; these tissues are prone to viral invasion.

## Face masks are of very limited benefit and may cause harm

> # *Influenza vaccines are bad medicine*

Multiple meta-analyses of more than 70 clinical research studies have shown that influenza vaccinations are, at best, minimally effective.\[R]\[R] At worst, the flu vaccine has the potential to damage the immune system, trigger autoimmune disease, paralyze your body (Guillain Barre Syndrome)\[R], and even kill recipients\[R].

In fact, flu vaccine injuries are the most frequent injury compensated by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Court System.\[R] What most people do not know is that the flu vaccine is merely a shortcut to becoming a super-spreader in the next vaccine enabled influenza pandemic.

## Influenza vaccinations increase susceptibility and transmissibility

The science that deserves explanation and serious consideration, is the evidence that the flu vaccines increase both susceptibility to, and transmissibility of, viral infections. Despite what you hear from doctors that provide and profit from vaccines, and the mainstream media beholden to the pharmaceutical industry that funds more than 70% of their advertising, the universal flu vaccine program is a dismal failure that is almost certainly increasing upper respiratory infections in highly flu vaccinated communities.

## Influenza vaccines increase susceptibility to respiratory virus infections, including coronaviruses

A growing body of Independent (unbiased) clinical research demonstrates that flu and other vaccines can damage and dysregulate the immune system in a way that leaves vaccinated individuals prone to developing a long list of acute, chronic, and deadly diseases. Through mechanisms that are incompletely understood, the flu vaccine has been shown to increase susceptibility to the more than 200 other viruses capable of causing influenza and influenza-like illness. For example, healthy military personnel in this Department of Defense study were found to be 36% more likely to present with a flu-like illness caused by coronavirus and metapneumovirus.\[R]

## Influenza vaccines increase transmission of respiratory viruses

Furthermore, not only are they more likely to become infected, they also become more infectious when they do. A study of community spread of upper respiratory viral infections (influenza-like illness) found that flu vaccine recipients coughed, sneezed, and breathed 640% more infectious viral particles than individuals that did not receive the flu vaccine.\[R] Thus, you are 640% more likely to become infected by someone that was made more susceptible and more infectious simply because they made the mistake of getting the flu vaccine.
