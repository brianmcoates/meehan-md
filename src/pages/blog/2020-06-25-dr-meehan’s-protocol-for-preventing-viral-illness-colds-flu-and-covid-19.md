Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,500. Check your blood levels using laboratory testing. Increase your dosing until you find a daily dose that maintains your serum vitamin D3 levels between 60 and 90 ng/dL.

* Option 1 (best absorption): [Liposomal D Supreme](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/liposomal-d-supreme), 0.5 mL (approx. 1 pump) and hold in mouth for 30 seconds before swallowing, 1 to 2 times per day. One pump provides vitamin D3 (2500 IU), vitamin K1 (200 mcg), vitamin K2 as MK-4 (100 mcg), and vitamin K2 as MK-7 (25 mcg).

## Garlic

* Option 1: 1 to 2 cloves (4 grams) of fresh raw garlic
* Option 2: [Allicillin™ 60 softgels](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/allicillin-60-softgel), 1 softgel, twice per day. Provides Garlicillin®, a blend of garlic oil and parsley oil with specified levels of garlic sulfides and ajoene, the most bioactive compound formed from garlic.

* Research suggests that like hydroxychloroquine, quercetin acts as a zinc ionophore to increase intracellular levels of zinc. Intracellular zinc inhibits viral polymerase and may inhibit viral replication in infected cells. Pairs perfectly with zinc.
* Research suggests that nettle’s anti-inflammatory actions are attributed to its ability to interrupt the production and actions of inflammation-producing cytokines, prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
