## DHEA

* DHEA: [DHEA 25 mg 60 vegetarian capsules](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/dhea-25-mg), men: 2 capsules / women: 1 capsule, in the morning.

The following information is extracted from an excellent [article on DHEA](https://lifeextensionvitamins.com/dhreth.html) from Life Extension Foundation:

A wealth of data indicates that DHEA is a vitally important hormone. DHEA appears to protect every part of the body against the ravages of aging. In fact, published studies link low levels of DHEA to aging and diseased states. Specifically, a deficiency of DHEA has been found to correlate with:

* Chronic inflammation
* Immune dysfunction
* Depression
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Type-II diabetic complications
* Greater risk for certain cancers
* Excess body fat
* Cognitive decline
* Heart disease in men
* Osteoporosis

DHEA did not establish scientific credibility until 1996, when the New York Academy of Sciences published a book entitled DHEA and Aging and summarized the concept of DHEA replacement in their journal Aging (Bellino et al. 1995). These highly technical publications provided scientific validation for the many life extension effects of DHEA replacement therapy. Despite the findings from thousands of peer-reviewed studies, the benefits of DHEA are still not recognized by mainstream medicine. DHEA replacement therapy involves the supplementation of the hormone to restore serum levels to those of a 21-year-old. DHEA is a precursory building block that allows our bodies to more easily create hormones that may be in decline because of age, disease, prescription medications, or other factors. Hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, as well as serum DHEA levels, begin to decline from 25-30 years of age and may be reduced by 95% of youthful peak levels by age 85.

## Elderberry

* Option 1: Elderberry Syrup, 15 mL, four times a day for 5 days
* Option 2: [ImmunoBerry™ Liquid 4 fl oz (118 mL)](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/immunoberry-liquid), 1 ml (35 drops), four times per day.
* ImmunoBerry™ Liquid provides immune support in a pleasant tasting liquid. Research suggests that certain herbs, mushrooms and other natural compounds have the ability to support normal immune functions such as natural killer (NK) cell activity, cytokine synthesis and the T-cell and B-cell mediated responses. The ingredients such as Elderberry, Shiitake and Wild Cherry Bark are known for their beneficial effects for maintaining a healthy immune system. ImmunoBerry™ Liquid is sweetened with glycerine and tastes great, and is ideal for both children and adults.

Randomized study of the efficacy and safety of oral elderberry extract in the treatment of influenza A and B virus infections.[[R](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/147323000403200205)]

In Norway, elderberry syrup was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of elderberry syrup. Symptoms were relieved an average of FOUR DAYS EARLIER than placebo. Which is at least 3.5 days better than Tamiflu and without Tamiflu’s adverse events risk (nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and suicidal behavior).

* Elderberry has been used in folk medicine for centuries to treat influenza, colds and sinusitis, and has been reported to have antiviral activity against influenza and herpes simplex. We investigated the efficacy and safety of oral elderberry syrup for treating influenza A and B infections.
* Sixty patients (aged 18-54 years) suffering from influenza-like symptoms for 48 h or less were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study during the influenza season of 1999-2000 in Norway.
* Patients received 15 ml of elderberry or placebo syrup four times a day for 5 days, and recorded their symptoms using a visual analogue scale.
* Symptoms were relieved on average 4 days earlier.
* The use of rescue medication was significantly less in those receiving elderberry extract compared with placebo.
* Elderberry extract seems to offer an efficient, safe and cost-effective treatment for influenza

## Garlic

* Option 1: 1 to 2 cloves (4 grams) of fresh raw garlic
* Option 2: [Allicillin™ 60 softgels](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/allicillin-60-softgel), 1 softgel, twice per day. Provides Garlicillin®, a blend of garlic oil and parsley oil with specified levels of garlic sulfides and ajoene, the most bioactive compound formed from garlic. These softgels are enteric coated to reduce the strong garlic odor and repeating that may occur from supplementing with garlic.

Garlic has long been hailed for its healing powers, especially against infectious diseases like cold and flu. This is likely due to its immune boosting effects. Fresh garlic is a potent antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agent. But its therapeutic effects may go much further than that.

### Garlic is less expensive, safer, and more effective than Tamiflu

For treatment of flu-like illnesses, I strongly recommend against the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), or any of the other neuraminidase inhibitors.

Tamiflu has been shown by reputable sources, such as the Cochrane Collaboration, to be almost completely ineffective. More concerning, the drug is associated with a high prevalence of serious adverse events, including psychosis and suicidality. When you consider Tamiflu’s serious risks with its limited efficacy, there is no reasonable justification for its use. It’s only being justified by those that profit from it’s manufacture and dispensing.

Garlic may be particularly useful in preparing for the cold and flu season. Fresh, raw garlic contains many compounds capable of inhibiting or eradicating a wide variety of organisms responsible for earaches, colds, and upper respiratory infections. The respected Cochrane Collaboration has also favorably reviewed research evidence supporting the use of garlic in the prevention or treatment of the viruses responsible for the common cold. The key results from the Cochrane review, “Garlic for the Common Cold” reported:

The included study found that people who took garlic every day for three months (instead of a placebo) had fewer colds. That is, over the three-month period, there were 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic group, compared to 65 in the placebo group. When participants experienced a cold, the length of illness was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63 days).[[R](https://www.cochrane.org/CD006206/ARI_garlic-common-cold)]

Those who consumed garlic daily for three months had fewer colds than those who took a placebo, and, when they did come down with a cold, the duration of illness was shorter. Thus, garlic is good medicine! In fact, it is far better, safer, and less expensive than the bad medicines bad doctors prescribe: neuraminidase inhibitors like Tamiflu.

### Why Tamiflu and drugs like it are bad medicine for the flu

Roche Pharmaceuticals used intolerably corrupt and bad science to bring Tamiflu to market and become a commonly prescribed treatment for the flu.[[R](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/01/28/tamiflu-fraud-stole-billions.aspx)][[R](https://www.forbes.com/sites/harlankrumholz/2013/01/08/the-myth-of-tamiflu-5-things-you-should-know/#3ffa9b005782)]

Tamiflu has multiple problems that make it inferior to the other solutions provided in this document. First, Tamiflu has to be taken within 48 hours of onset of illness or it is ineffective. Second, even if taken properly, clinical research demonstrates that Tamiflu only reduces the duration of flu symptoms by about half of a day. Third, Tamiflu has been shown to induce serious side effects. In fact, the side-effect profile of the neuraminidase inhibitors has resulted in countries like Japan to no longer recommend its use, especially in children.<!--StartFragment-->

Does paying more than one hundred dollars for a drug that provides negligible benefits and subject users to the risks of serious adverse events (headaches, serious skin reactions, neuropsychiatric events, and suicide) make sense?! No, it doesn’t make sense. But because prescribing Tamiflu makes lots of dollars for the pharmaceutical manufacturers and the doctors paid to prescribe it, this bad medicine continues to be used.

Don’t waste your money and risk your life on Tamiflu or drugs like it. Instead, consider using garlic in combination with the many other evidence-based, safe, and effective recommendations that follow.

## Oregano oil - 3 times per day

* [Oil of Oregano 120 softgels](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/oil-of-oregano-150-mg-120-softgels), 60 mg, 1-3 times per day.
* Oil of Oregano has powerful antioxidant and intestinal cleansing benefits. It also helps to maintain a healthy microbial balance. This product is standardized for carvacrol and thymol, the principal phenolic compounds in oregano, with each softgel providing 36 mg carvacrol and thymol from an impressive 60-75% carvacrol oregano oil.
* Oregano contains two compounds, carvacrol and thymol, that possess powerful antibacterial and antifungal properties. The predominant compound, carvacrol, is arguably the most potent and important of the two. The higher the carvacrol concentration, the more effective the oregano oil.

## Mushrooms

* Beta glucans and proteoglycans are the primary biologically active compounds in the mushroom fruit body and mycelia that support your immune system.

## Immunity tea (ImmuniTEA)

* Recommended ingredients:
* 1. Ginger
  2. Orange peel (or the peel of any citrus fruit)
  3. Onion
  4. Garlic
  5. Green tea
  6. Rosemary
  7. Cayenne (and other spices)

* Among other benefits, this combination causes you to sweat, which is helpful for eradicating a virus from your system.

## Chicken soup

* Chicken contains a natural amino acid called cysteine, which can thin the mucus in your lungs and make it less sticky so you can expel it more easily.
* Furthermore, a well made chicken soup is loaded with essential nutrients the body needs to not only fight the acute infection, but to support optimal health.
* Make sure the soup is made with clean, organic, GMO-free ingredients and chicken that isn’t “grown” in an industrial chicken farm.
* Chicken soup from a tin can does not count and is not recommended. You are better off making the good/real stuff.
* The more spices the better.

## Hot soup

* Garlic, onions, ginger, root vegetables.
* The more spices the better.

## Propolis

* A bee resin and one of the most broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds in the world; [propolis](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/11/17/this-bee-product-has-enormous-benefits-for-your-health.aspx) is also the richest source of caffeic acid and apigenin, two very important compounds that aid in immune response.

## Olive leaf extract

* [Olive Leaf Extract 90 vegetarian capsules](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/olive-leaf-extract-500mg-90s), 500 mg, 1 capsule, 1-3 times per day.
* Olive Leaf Extract contains significant quantities of phenolic compounds, such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol that have been shown to have antimicrobial properties, antioxidant power, and have the ability to support phagocytosis. It can also be used to support the health of the cardiovascular system.
* Ancient Egyptians and Mediterranean cultures used it for a variety of health-promoting uses and it is widely known as a natural, non-toxic immune system builder.
