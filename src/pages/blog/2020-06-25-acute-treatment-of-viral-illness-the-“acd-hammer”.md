Vitamins A, C, and D are the keys to supporting and strengthening your immune system against microbial pathogens.
Dr. Meehan’s protocol for viral Illnesses: colds, flu, and corona viruses is intended for the acute treatment of any upper respiratory viral infection. At the first signs of symptoms, “hammer” the virus with at least 3 days of megadoses of the immune supporting vitamins A, C, and D. If you weren’t already supplementing according to the <!--StartFragment-->**["Prevention Protocol,"](https://www.meehanmd.com/blog/2020-06-25-dr-meehan%E2%80%99s-protocol-for-preventing-viral-illness-colds-flu-and-covid-19/)**<!--EndFragment--> begin it immediately.

## Vitamin A 50,000 IU, 4 times per day (200,000 IU per day), for 3 days

<!--StartFragment-->

* [Vitamin A - Acnutrol™ capsules 180 vegetarian capsules](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/acnutrol-capsules-180-ct)

The rationale for vitamin A: Vitamin A is a necessary substrate for preserving epithelial cell integrity and in addition plays a role in immune modulation.

Multiple clinical investigations have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of vitamin A in viral illnesses, including the measles. In fact, vitamin A treatment of children with measles in developing countries has been associated with significant reductions in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) when administered during the acute phase of illness (within 5 days of the onset of rash).

The benefits of vitamin A supplementation are so well recognized that the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) have issued a joint statement recommending that vitamin A be administered to all children diagnosed with measles in communities where vitamin A deficiency (serum vitamin A <10 µg/dL) is a recognized problem and where mortality related to measles is ≥1%.[[R](https://www.who.int/elena/titles/bbc/vitamina_pneumonia_children/en/)][[R](https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Vitamin_A_Supplementation.pdf)]

In the presence of ophthalmologic signs of vitamin A deficiency, such as night blindness, Bitot's spots (grayish white deposits on the bulbar conjunctiva adjacent to the cornea) or xerophthalmia, the WHO recommends the dose be repeated in 24 hours, and again 4 weeks later.\[R]

Vitamin A is available in low-cost liquid formulations that can be easily administered to infants and young children.

## Vitamin C 1-3 grams, every hour while awake, for 3 days

#### Adults

* Option 1: [C+BioFizz™ 144 g powder](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/c-plus-bio-fizz-effervescent-144g-powder), start with a loading dose of 1.5 teaspoons (3.9 g vitamin C). Then take 3/4 teaspoon (2 g vitamin C) every hour while awake. Continue for 3 days. This formulation also includes the natural citrus fruit bioflavonoids quercetin (20 mg), hesperidin (20 mg) and rutin (10 mg).
* Option 2: [Vitamin C Buffered Powder 240 g (8.5 oz)](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/buffered-vitamin-c-powder-240g), start with an initial loading dose of 2 teaspoons (4 g vitamin C). Then take 1 teaspoon (2 g vitamin C) every hour while awake. Continue for 3 days.

Begin “hammering” vitamin C as soon as you experience symptoms of a respiratory infection.

Begin with an initial (loading) dose of 3 to 4 grams (3,000 to 4,000 mg). Then dose 2,000 mg every hour or until you begin to experience bowel symptoms such as mild discomfort, increased flatulence (gas), and loose stools (mild diarrhea). This marks your level of “bowel tolerance” for vitamin C.

When you hit “bowel tolerance,” back the dose down slightly. For example, if you were taking 2,000 mg every hour, back the dose down to 1,000 mg every hour. You could also consider spreading the doses out to 2 hour intervals. Adjust dose and frequency as needed for bowel tolerance, but try to keep your vitamin C intake as high as you can tolerate. Ideally, aim for 2,000 mg per hour at least six times per day.

For best results and to prevent relapse, I recommend continuing the protocol for 1-2 days after you are feeling better.

#### Children

For children, I recommend liposomal forms of vitamin C. Liposomal formulations absorb better. They can also be easily added to liquids or foods, which makes giving them to young children much easier. The amount of Vitamin C in most children’s multivitamins does not come close to dosing required to prevent or treat viral illnesses.

At the first signs of symptoms or concern that your child may have been exposed to someone with a cold or flu, consider the following intervention:

* [Liposomal Vitamin C](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/liposomal-vitamin-c), Each 5 mL serving (approximately 1 teaspoon) of this lemon flavored formula provides 1000 mg vitamin C, as sodium ascorbate. The 130 mg sodium per serving helps to further facilitate absorption of vitamin C.
* Liposomal Vitamin C provides this key foundational nutrient formulated with liposomal technology. Liposomes are spheres made of phospholipids—the primary building blocks of cell membranes. Owing to this structure, liposomes bond easily with cell membranes to facilitate intracellular delivery of their nutrient cargo. Thanks to this enhanced delivery and absorption, nutrients delivered in liposomal form offer superior absorption and bioavailability.
* Dosing based on age of child:
* * 150 mg daily for Infants less than 6 months.
  * 300 mg daily for children 6-12 months.
  * 500 mg daily for children above 12 months.
  * Children above 5 years can take up to 3,000 mg a day 3 days before and after vaccinations.
* Pre- and Post-Vaccination Treatment: I recommend an age and weight adjusted version of this protocol for all children undergoing vaccinations. The battery of multiple vaccines that children receive at 6 and 12 months of age are particularly challenging to the immune and central nervous systems of young children. Most parents do not fully appreciate how common vaccine adverse events and injuries are today.

## Vitamin D3 (with K2) 10,000 IU, 5 times per day (50,000 IU per day), for 3 days

#### Adults

* [Vitamin D Ultra 10K 60 vegetarian capsules](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/vitamin-d-ultra-10k-60-caps), 1 capsule, 5 times per day for 3 days. One capsule provides vitamin D3 (10,000 IU), vitamin K1 (200 mcg), and vitamin K2 as MK-7 (20 mcg).
* The results are dramatic, with complete resolution of symptoms in 48 to 72 hours. Vitamin D dosed at these and even higher levels has been used safely and [shown to be safe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4463890/#b8-0610507).

#### Children

* [Liposomal D Supreme](https://meehanmd.ehealthpro.com/products/liposomal-d-supreme), Each 0.5 mL serving (1 pump) of this citrus flavored formula provides 2500 IU of vitamin D3 and 325 mcg of vitamin K as K1 and K2.
* I recommend 50 IU's of vitamin D per pound of body weight.
* Liquid vitamin D in a liposomal form is a good way to deliver vitamin D to children.
* The mothers of children young enough to breastfeed should protect themselves with the adult protocol. Boosting your immune system will boost your child’s immune system.
* Breastfeed if at all possible. Children are protected by antibodies and all the other immune elements that are found in mother’s breast milk.

The cost of vitamin D is about a penny for 1000 IU, so this treatment costs less than a dollar.
