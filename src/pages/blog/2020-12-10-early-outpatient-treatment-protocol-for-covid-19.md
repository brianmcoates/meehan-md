# Forward

As we approach the conclusion of a full year under the cloud of the CoVID-19 pandemic, I have reached the conclusion that the American medical-hospital-industrial-complex has shamefully and tragically failed to properly treat patients with CoVID-19. The medical establishment’s “standard of care” CoVID treatments are abject failures.

> The medical establishment’s failure to recognize life saving at-home treatments for CoVID-19 has resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives

Not a day goes by that I don’t receive a report from a CoVID-19 patient about how their primary care physician left them hopeless and terrified with claims that there is nothing they can do to treat CoVID-19 but quarantine, wear a mask, and when the virus destroys their ability to breathe, they should go to the hospital. Given the overwhelming evidence that there is so much more that can be done in the early stages of infection, I believe this approach constitutes medical negligence.

Hospital care is not working; patients are dying at intolerable rates in hospitals. The financially lucrative medical charade of scientifically worthless interventions (e.g., [remdesivir](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-recommends-against-the-use-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-patients) and [mechanical ventilators](https://www.globalresearch.ca/are-ventilators-killing-more-people-than-saving/5709562)) is a blight on the history of medicine. A skeptic might reasonably wonder whether the whole system was intentionally designed for failure, because failure pays way more ($3,200 courses of remdesivir and $39,000 bonuses for mechanical ventilation) than successfully intervening early with outpatient, inexpensive, safe, and effective treatments.

I blame the failures of our medical system during this pandemic on financially biased corporations, public health authorities, and the intolerable censorship of independent scientific evidence by the mainstream media and social media/technology platforms. The medical community and public are being intentionally deprived of the large and growing body of scientific evidence (see https://c19study.com/) demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of life saving therapeutics. The therapeutics recommended here, started early, properly dosed, properly timed, and combined with the necessary activating agents (e.g., zinc is necessary and essential for the full action of hydroxychloroquine and quercetin), are far more effective than the “standard of care” (dexamethasone and remdesivir). Early treatment with the therapeutics recommended and discussed here dramatically decrease disease severity, prevent hospitalizations, and saves lives.

## Treatment should begin as soon as possible, preferably within the first 5 days of symptoms.

\[2] Hydroxychloroquine is a generally safe medication, however, there is a risk that the medication could adversely impact heart health.

\[3] Dr. Meehan recommends very careful consideration of the timing of administration of corticosteroids (e.g., budesonide, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone) or any immuno-suppressive drug during active infections. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is generally believed to be most actively replicating during the first eight (8) days of symptoms. Suppressing the natural immune response with corticosteroid therapy during the first eight days, a time in which the virus is actively and rapidly replicating, could weaken the immune response, facilitate viral replication, and worsen the severity of the infection. Therefore, Dr. Meehan recommends reserving corticosteroid treatment for approximately day eight after the onset of symptoms.

\[4] Quercetin, like hydroxychloroquine, drives zinc inside cells where the zinc serves to inhibit viral replication. Quercetin is an OTC nutritional supplement that is available without a doctor’s prescription.

Quercetin is believed to increase intracellular zinc levels in a manner that is similar to that of hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, quercetin can act as a reasonable substitute for hydroxychloroquine in patients with cardiac risk factors or concerns regarding the safety profile of hydroxychloroquine.

If quercetin is unavailable, then use Epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG), 400 mg, 1 time a day. (<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf5014633>)

# Therapeutics Discussion and References

## Ivermectin

Ivermectin is an extremely safe drug that has been taken billions of times, for anti-parasitic purposes. For example, it has been recommended for mass administration by the World Health Organization for fighting onchocerciasis (a parasitic disease; aka, river blindness).

The most up to date review of the literature about the effectiveness of Ivermectin for COVID-19 is by Professor Pierre Kory, MD, from St. Luke’s Aurora Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI and several collaborators, including Professor Joseph Varon, MD, from the University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX, and Professor Paul Marik, MD, from the Eastern Virginia Medical School.

The review concludes:

“In summary, based on the existing and cumulative body of evidence, we recommend the use of ivermectin in both prophylaxis and treatment for COVID-19. In the presence of a global COVID-19 surge, the widespread use of this safe, inexpensive, and effective intervention could lead to a drastic reduction in transmission rates as well as the morbidity and mortality in mild, moderate, and even severe disease phases.”

You can find the review at: <https://osf.io/wx3zn/>

In my professional opinion (Jim Meehan, MD), after reviewing the large and growing body of both the experimental and clinical research on the use of ivermectin in the treatment of CoVID-19, I am convinced that the evidence strongly supports the efficacy and safety of ivermectin. In my medical practice, I am currently using ivermectin as my primary means of prophylaxis and treatment of CoVID-19.

The [FLCCC](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FLCCC-Ivermectin-in-the-prophylaxis-and-treatment-of-COVID-19.pdf) Alliance [recommendation for ivermectin](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FLCCC-Ivermectin-in-the-prophylaxis-and-treatment-of-COVID-19.pdf) is based on the following set of conclusions derived from the existing data, which will be comprehensively reviewed below:

1. Since 2012, multiple in-vitro studies have demonstrated that Ivermectin inhibits the replication of many viruses, including influenza, Zika, Dengue and others\[10-18]
2. Ivermectin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, leading to absence of nearly all viral material by 48h in infected cell cultures\[19]
3. Ivermectin has potent anti-inflammatory properties with in-vitro data demonstrating profound inhibition of both cytokine production and transcription of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), the most potent mediator of inflammation\[20-22]
4. Ivermectin significantly diminishes viral load and protects against organ damage when administered to mice upon infection with a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2\[23]
5. Ivermectin prevents transmission and development of COVID-19 disease in those exposed to infected patients\[24-26,43]
6. Ivermectin hastens recovery and prevents deterioration in patients with mild to moderate disease treated early after symptoms\[28-32,43]
7. Ivermectin hastens recovery and avoidance of ICU admission and death in hospitalized patients\[32,33,43]
8. Ivermectin reduces mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19\[33,34]
9. Ivermectin leads to striking reductions in case-fatality rates in regions with widespread use\[35-37]
10. The safety, availability, and cost of ivermectin is nearly unparalleled given its near nil drug interactions along with only mild and rare side effects observed in almost 40 years of use and billions of doses administered\[38]
11. The World Health Organization has long included ivermectin on its “List of Essential Medicines”\[39]

## Doxycycline

Doxycycline is one of the most common antibiotics. Like Ivermectin, it is on the list of the Essential Medicines of the World Health Organization.

## Ivermectin plus Doxycycline

Both drugs are extremely safe, including when taken jointly.

Both drugs are approved in Canada, the US and most other countries and can be prescribed off-label.

## Hydroxychloroquine

As of December 4, 2020 at 12:26 pm, the [c19study.com](https://c19study.com/) website reports that there are 189 studies of hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), 124 of which are peer reviewed. 100% of the studies that evaluated the use of HCQ early in the course of the disease showed positive effects compared to those that were not treated with HCQ. Of these studies the median improvement was 64%.

By the time you read this the number of studies is likely to have both increased and reported outcomes improved.

We also know that physicians all over the world are reporting positive outcomes when patients with symptomatic cases of CoVID-19 are treated early.

Both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are autophagy inhibitors which alter the acidity in lysosomes. The virus uses lysosomes for replication. By altering acidity in the lysosomes, coronavirus replication is prevented.

This is explained in this article: Yang, Naidi, and Han-Ming Shen. “[Targeting the Endocytic Pathway and Autophagy Process as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy in COVID-19](https://www.ijbs.com/v16p1724.htm).” Int J Biol Sci 16.10 (2020): 1724-1731.
