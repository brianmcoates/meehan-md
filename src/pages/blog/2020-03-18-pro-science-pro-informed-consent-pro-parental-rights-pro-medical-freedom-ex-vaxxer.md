I am also a physician and former medical journal editor. I come to my conclusions and positions only after a great amount of research, deep understanding, and very careful consideration. I have no financial interests in my vaccine positions. Despite the fallacious attacks and claims of my detractors, I do not treat vaccine injuries, nor do I sell products for those injured by vaccines. Unlike my physician colleagues profiting from administering vaccines in their clinics (or shares of Merck stock), my thoughts are my own, they are not conflicted, financially biased, or owned by the pharmaceutical industry.

I never intended or wanted to devote so much of the last decade researching the medical literature surrounding vaccines, the corrupt politics that got us here, or being broken to tears by the stories of parents that lost their children to vaccine injury. Nevertheless, here I am. I speak out because it is my duty to do so. As a physician, I took an oath to do no harm. As a member of the U.S. military, I took an oath to serve and protect. As a follower of Christ, I was created to protect those that cannot protect themselves.

Little by little my mind has opened the evidence of harm. I found increasing evidence of fraudulent, bought, and corrupt research science contrived to mislead the public into believing lies like, "vaccines are safe and effective" or "vaccines don't cause autism." I have read both sides of the argument and find the evidence used to support vaccines is based on fraud, corruption, and scientific methodologies that would not be tolerated in a middle school science class. For example, the lack of TRUE PLACEBO control safety studies and the utter failure to conduct VACCINATED versus UNVACCINATED studies is intolerable, pseudoscientific, and dishonest.

The evidence refuting the pseudoscience and overt misinformation of the vaccine industry is not difficult to find. The evidence is found in the independent medical literature, that is, medical research that was not bought and paid for by the vaccine manufacturers. A multitude of research studies have clearly described the evidence and mechanisms of harm caused by vaccines. JB Handley's new book, "How to End the Autism Epidemic" describes it all beautifully. JB Handley describes why the evidence that the exponential rise in autism, now 1 in 28 children, is almost certainly being caused by vaccines can not be denied.

The government agencies created to protect the public are not only negligent, they are complicit in the fraud that allows the harm to continue and grow, especially in our children. Thanks to the #CDCwhistleblower, Dr. William Thompson, and the documentary, "VAXXED: From Coverup to Catastrophe," we now know that the CDC manipulated the data to hide the fact that their 2004 study demonstrated that Merck's MMR vaccine was associated with a significant increase in autism. CDC research scientists met in secret, destroyed documents, and presented a fraudulent conclusion. The CDC is not alone in denying and burying the evidence that the untested U.S. vaccine schedule is harming far more children than the public is being told.

The scientific and research evidence, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the testimony of experts, $4 BILLION payouts from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation System, and the epidemic of children with neurodevelopmental disorders flooding and overwhelming the school systems, are more than enough evidence to demand action. The conclusion that vaccines can inflame and damage brain tissue and they can and do harm and kill their recipients is undeniable. We know, medical science and the vaccine court system has confirmed, that certain subsets of children are clearly more susceptible to this damage - and the subset is not a small percentage. But nothing is being done to identify and protect these children, because doing so would require admitting BigPharma, the CDC, and doctors were wrong, ignorant, and lying.

Thus, the vaccine manufacturers and their medical doctor mouthpieces are guilty of harming our children with their untested, fraudulent, toxic products. For these reasons and many more, I am an ex-vaxxer. I will protect as many as I can.
