  The CDC knows that vaccines can cause autism, sleep disorders, speech
  disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders in susceptible individuals. They
  just don't want anyone else to know.

This is my response to the "Vaxxed versus Unvaxxed" presentation provided by the Children's Health Defense Fund. [https://childrenshealthdefense.org/‚Ä¶/fully-vaccinated-vs-u‚Ä¶/](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/child-health-topics/exposing-truth/fully-vaccinated-vs-unvaccinated/?fbclid=IwAR3GiqUFJ6-vfyuKpkRe2BWycdJe_LlHsrblWYIBm93WWX7J8N4lUhJe3Ks)

PART 1: CDC‚Äôs Verstraeten Study Showed the Thimerosal Preserved Hep B Vaccine Dramatically Increased Risk of Autism (7.6x), Sleep Disorders (5x), Speech Disorders (2.1x), and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (1.8x)

CDC UNPUBLISHED DATA OBTAINED BY FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA) REQUEST (obtained by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Children‚Äôs Health Defense Fund, and Del Bigtree, Informed Consent Action Network) \[2]

This unpublished CDC study was presented at the April, 2000 Epidemic Intelligence Service (ESI) Annual Conference. The study was directly conducted by CDC epidemiologists, notably, Verstraeten and DeStefano\[3], using the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database. The study included immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between 1991 and 1997. CDC's Unpublished Verstraeten Study on Hep B Showed Dramatic Increased Risk of:

\- Autism (7.6x)

\- Sleep Disorders (5x)

\- Speech Disorders (2.1x)

\- Neurodevelopmental Disorders (1.8x)

The conclusion reads:

"The relative risk (RR) of developing a neurologic development disorder was 1.8 (95% confidence intervals \[Cl] = 1.1-2.8) when comparing the highest exposure group at 1 month of age (cumulative dose > 25 ùúág) to the unexposed group. Within this group we also found an elevated risk for the following disorders: autism RR 7.6, 95% CI=1.8-31.5), nonorganic sleep disorder (RR 5.0, 95% CI=1.6-15.9), and speech disorders (RR 2.1, 95% CI=1.1-4.0).‚Äù

Given the inconvenient information revealed by this study, the reasons for its remaining hidden for so long seems obvious. This study was meant to remain unseen and unexamined by anyone beyond the CDC‚Äôs internal vaccine cabal. In my opinion, the CDC's failure to publish and support the ability of the scientific and medical communities to scrutinize the data and conclusions of the Verstraeten (2000) Hep B/thimerosal study constitutes scientific fraud, negligence, and an overt betrayal of the American public.

In fact, it smells exactly like the fraud DeStefano was involved in during this same time period, the MMR/autism study fraud exposed by the [\#CDCwhistleblower](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cdcwhistleblower?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG), Dr. William Thompson. For that story, watch "Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe."

I have little doubt that, just as they did in the MMR/autism study, the CDC tried to scrub this study from existence and trust the public's short memories to forget the alarming revelation that another vaccine, Hep B or the 30 other thimerosal preserved vaccines on the market at the time, might be implicated in damaging the brains of children. To the CDC's chagrin, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Del Bigtree forced the CDC to produce the original study documents so we could once again be warned and aware of the problem we have with vaccine science and safety.

I know there are many that have spent two decades or more fighting for the truth, scientific integrity, and an end to industry fraud and corruption. To the long-time fighters, this study and the Simpsonwood CDC Conference transcript that followed, may be old news. For me, seeing this alarming study for the first time was a painful reminder of the long history of fraud, corruption, and cover-ups that involve seemingly every level of the vaccine industry. Somehow, reasonable people have failed to prevent the loss of critical checks, balances and safety oversight. Vaccine safety and science has devolved into a mess of massive conflicts of interests, pharma funding of federal agencies, a giant revolving door between public agencies and industry, an intolerable lack of rigorous, gold-standard, inert placebo controlled safety testing for vaccines delivered to healthy children, and vaccine manufacturers that are immune to product liability lawsuits when their products harm or kill our children.

Background: Concern has risen on the presence of the ethylmercury containing preservative thimerosal in vaccines. We assessed the risk for neurologic and renal impairment associated with past exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine using automated data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). VSD is a large linked database from four health maintenance organizations in Washington, Oregon and California Containing immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between 1991 and 1997.

Methods: We categorized the cumulative ethylmercury exposure from thimerosal containing vaccines after one month of Life and assessed the subsequent risk of degenerative and developmental neurologic disorders and renal disorders before the age of six. We applied proportional hazard models adjusting for HMO, year of birth, and gender, excluding premature babies

Results: We identified 286 children with degenerative and 3702 with developmental neurologic disorders, and 310 with renal disorders. The relative risk (RR) of developing a neurologic development disorder was 1.8 (95% confidence intervals \[CI] = 1.1-2.8) when comparing the highest exposure group at 1 month of age (cumulative dose > 25 ùúág to the unexposed group. Within this group we also found an elevated risk for the following disorders: autism (RR 7.6, 95% CI=1.8-315), nonorganic sleep disorder (RR 50.95% CI=16-15.9) and speech disorders (RR 2.1, 95% CI=1.1-40). For the neurologic degenerative and renal disorders group we found no significantly increased risk or a decreased risk.

Conclusion: This analysis suggests that high exposure to ethyl-mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life increases the risk of subsequent development of neurologic development impairment, but not of neurologic degenerative or renal impairment. Further confirmatory studies are needed.

\[3] It is worth noting that DeStefano was also the lead author of the infamous 2004 CDC study in which children who received Merck‚Äôs MMR vaccine were found to have a significantly increased risk of autism (e.g., 340% increased risk in African American boys). It was not until 2014 that the lead statistician on the study, William Thompson, PhD, (the #CDCwhistleblower) came forward to blow the whistle on how the CDC investigators, lead by DeStefano, gathered to destroy the documented evidence that showed a strong link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

Fortunately, Dr. Thompson, knowing what his fellow CDC scientists were doing was illegal, secretly kept a copy of the study data. Then, in 2014, ‚Äúout of his guilt and shame‚Äù Thompson came forward to not only report the scientific malfeasance perpetrated by his fellow investigators, but he also turned over the study documents to Brian Hooker and Rep. William Posey (R-FL). Those documents are now the hard evidence that should indict DeStefano and his fellow investigators for the scientific fraud they committed.

Unfortunately, the CDC continues to use legal loopholes to obstruct demands that Thompson testify before congress.

Watch "Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe" for a full understanding of the fraud and corruption perpetrated by CDC scientists when the 2004 CDC study found an increased risk of autism in children vaccinated with Merck's MMR vaccine.
