The rediscovery of drugs like hydroxychloroquine should awaken everyone to the problem with Big Pharma’s control over the medical system, science, and public health agencies.

Below is a short list of the clinical conditions, diseases, and cancers for which I found well designed studies that demonstrated reasonably solid evidence for the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a therapeutic (by itself and in combination with other drugs). This list is by no means exhaustive. There is far more evidence out there. I stopped reviewing the studies after exhausting myself on less than a hundred of the thousands of studies available.

Many of these studies conclude that the safety and efficacy evidence is so strong that confirmatory studies must urgently be performed. And yet, our public health agencies, CDC, NIH, WHO, etc., appear to have largely ignored the call and failed to fund the studies that only they can...and which pharma has every reason and billions of dollars to make sure they don’t.

To give you an idea of just how much has been evading the attention of the medical establishment, let’s start with a short list of the diseases for which HCQ has been clinically demonstrated to be a safe and effective therapeutic:

CANCER (in general) [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5718030/](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC5718030%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2N-VNXKatk5PU0VAcrF_qSOWEdi_lGi6vBuzAL08rPxYKlHkMG6sVvGio&h=AT1Vjl0NcfiNR4Ly0r41uXewzrazLMBVZWubptcMvkxuWLyKjmt7LgE502WGEqXSMj4sd-ifd2ABV3BbzM4TBALQeKpjX61V-oHsqkzdlRkWhm3EOHorntmCN-m54br32mj84FzJKwYFOUHNYJAnsIYqYuO9o0w)]\

Melanoma\
Myeloma (relapsed/refractory)\
B-chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells\
Asthma, severe chronic (steroid sparing effect)\
Alzheimer's dementia\
Diabetes (improves insulin sensitivity in obese non-diabetics)\
Diabetes (decompensated treatment for refractory non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus)\
Malaria (of course)\
Schizophrenia (“significant ameliorating effect”)\
Systemic erythematous lupus\
Lupus panniculitis\

Discoid lupus profundus in children\
Antiphospholipid syndrome\
Severe multicentric reticulohistiocytosis\
Cutaneous sarcoidal granulomas\
Chronic urticaria\
Dermatomyositis\

Q fever

If we were all more aware of the extraordinary body of science supporting CQ and HCQ, the promise these dirt cheap drugs hold, and the way safe, effective, and inexpensive drugs in general may be being ignored so that pharma could push forward a more profitable alternative, we would storm the gates of the CDC, NIH, and WHO with torches and pitchforks demanding better. Well, now you know. Grab your torches and pitchforks. It’s time to demand better
