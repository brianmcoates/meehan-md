    Jim will help you  do blahblah and stuff is the coffee store for everyone
    who believes that great coffee shouldn't just taste good, it should do good
    too. We source all of our beans directly from small scale sustainable
    farmers and make sure part of the profits are reinvested in their
    communities.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
